## How to use the User Interface
### Before you open this workbook, ensure Excel Trust Center is set to accept and run workbooks with code. Once complete, continuing reading below for more details on how to use the program! We will open the program in a little bit!
### The first thing you will come to is the Navigation page. 
#### There are 3 areas on the page to familarize yourself with:
##### 1. A brief description of what you should expect to happen and what it will do for you
##### 2. There are two categories of buttons. One will walk you through the results of the module (in blue, which collorlate with the tab colors), and the other will walk you through the challenge results (in red, which collorate with the tab colors).
##### 3. Once you are done, there is a button in the upper right hand corner. Clicking it will save and close the program for you.

## Run Time
### You are a busy individual, and the last thing you want is a slow running program. We took the time to look over our code, ensuring it runs as smoothly and effeciently as possible. Below you can see how much faster the code ran once we refactored the code.
