# Enhanced Stock Analysis Program
##### Using Code to find trends and results, effiecently and faster
---
###### Purpose: This document will provide you a preview of how to use the program, and what the program will tel you.

## How to use the User Interface
### Before you open this workbook, ensure Excel Trust Center is set to accept and run workbooks with code. Once complete, continuing reading below for more details on how to use the program! We will open the program in a little bit!
### The first thing you will come to is the Navigation page. 
#### There are 3 areas on the page to familarize yourself with:
##### 1. A brief description of what you should expect to happen and what it will do for you
##### 2. There are two categories of buttons. One will walk you through the results of the module (in blue, which collorlate with the tab colors), and the other will walk you through the challenge results (in red, which collorate with the tab colors).
##### 3. Once you are done, there is a button in the upper right hand corner. Clicking it will save and close the program for you.

###### Beautiful, right?

## Run Time
### You are a busy individual, and the last thing you want is a slow running program. We took the time to look over our code, ensuring it runs as smoothly and effeciently as possible. Below you can see how much faster the code ran once we refactored the code.

#### Take a look at the same results, but with refactored code:

### Amazing right? Lets run 2018....

### You can see there was a transformative difference in run time. While this doesn't add up to much after one or two runs, it will add up to days, hours, and weeks after using the program for a few years.

## Results of running the program
### Doing a side by side comparison of 2017 and 2018 without knowing what specific economic changes occurred, we can see come drastic changes!
#### To ensure we are defining vocabulary the same way; when you see volume, we are looking at how many shares have been traded. Looking at the return, we are using the beginning of the year as a baseline, and seeing where the stock closed at on last weekday (non-holiday) of the year.
##### As you can see there are a variety of situations going on. Some companys saw in increase in trades, wtih a decline in return, while others saw a reduction in trades and decline in return. ENPH is a an interesting situation because it showed a substantial return both years, plus a significent increase in trades. I suspect this company may have an interest in splitting stocks to level out trades and stock value, making it less volatile. DQ shows a significant increase in trades, and a very large drop in return. This could indicate that entities who held large amounts of shares sold it off before the decline hit. In 2017 you can see the majority held onto their shares, making a very good return.
